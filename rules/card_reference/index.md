# Card Reference

Dragon's Money Laundering is designed to work on minimal resources. To squeeze out enough complexity out of limited amount of tokens DML utilizes *polymorphism*. Basically this means that cards can mean different things in different Game Zones. Each card in the deck has been assigned one or more classes. These classes define the interface how they can be used and in which Game Zones can they be played during gameplay.

This rules section explains all the different Card Classes and their possible subclasses. Additionally, there is a Card Index that takes these Card Classes and assigns them to each respective cards of the deck. Card Index also lists all the card specific powers granted by different classes and as such is the primary source of reference after a Player has firmly grasped the concept and content of Card Classes.

# Card Classes

## What is a Card Class?

In Dragon's Money Laundering classes are keywords attached to certain playing cards. Each card has one or more classes attached to it that govern how their effects will resolve in different Game Zones. Usually, in gameplay situations the rules indicate which card class triggers the rule, or which card class can be played at the given time. If necessary, at those times the Player needs to refer to the Card Index and double-check the given card's inherent classes.

## List of Card Classes

The possible Card Class tuples can be formed by using these base classes. If a rule matches any member of the class tuple of a card, it is triggered or the card is considered valid at that point.

* Merchant King
* Dragon Egg
* Character
* Resource
* Guild House
* Emblem
* Global Event
* Foreign Merchant

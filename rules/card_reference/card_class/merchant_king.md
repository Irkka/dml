# Merchant King

Merchant King cards represent the Players themselves in the Realm and in the city of Four Corners.

Each Player may control only one Merchant King card at maximum.

Though they don't directly affect the gameplay through rules, their primary function is to generate an incentive for the Player, an unambiguous goal, and give a fighting chance to victory even before the Player can form more elaborate tactics and achieve more difficult Victory Conditions. Provided that nothing unexpected happens during the game, collecting one's Secret Desired Resource is an almost surefire tactic at winning; denying another Player of their own is the next step to becoming a truly good Player.

## Attributes

### Secret Desired Resource

Merchant King's Secret Desired Resource is the printed suite on the card. Thus, possible Secret Desired Resources are: Slaves, Spice, Iron and Wood.

Each Merchant King card indicates the Secret Desired Resource of the controlling Player. The Secret Desired Resource is an integral part of [Victory Point](/rules/gameplay/victory_condition/victory_point) Victory Condition. The Player will receive double the Victory Points from each Resource card that has a matching Resource Type with the Player's Secret Desired Resource.

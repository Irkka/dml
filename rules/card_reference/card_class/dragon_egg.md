### Victory Points

A Dragon Egg card provides a flat 20 Victory Points if a Player has one in one's Treasury at the Victory Point counting phase. 

*A Dragon Egg is not a Resource.* The Dragon Eggs have no Resource Type and thus won't receive the Secret Desired Resource Victory Point Bonus at the end of the Game.

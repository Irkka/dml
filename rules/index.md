*Dear Billy,*

Look how you've grown, m'boy. Seems like yesterday when you we're still selling cattle at the Outpost market square. Yet, it has become time for you to travel to Four Corners, the crown jewel of the Realm, where the borders of great kingdoms meet. In there battles are not fought by steel but by gold and cunning. At the ever-buzzing Grand Market Place of Four Corners precious commodities of the Realm tirelessly change hands. In there eager men and noble women acquire and forfeit great fortunes. Watch them squander their gold, while making sure you won't share their fate.

There are many ways to bring glory and wealth to your kingdom. Gathering resources and honest trading are but a single way to achieve your goals.

Good luck!

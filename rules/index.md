## Introduction

In a land governed by capitalism, there lives four merchant kings – each mighty in their own respects. One is know for his superior military prowess; the second for his unparalleled mastery of all things clandestine; the third for his dominion over untold number of beasts and men; and the fourth for his immeasurable riches. The kingdoms ruled by these men share a border – a single point – that divides the realm in four. This place is the free city of Four Corners – the epicenter for the future events to unravel.

**Dragon's Money Laundering** is a card game for 3-4 players that takes approximately 1½ hours to finish.

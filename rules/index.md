# The Rules

In the game of Dragon's Money Laundering a deck of regular playing cards is used to represent various events, commodities and characters in the city of Four Corners. The two six-sided dice introduce an another level of probabilities and model the uncertain nature of doing business in the Realm, thus guiding Players to generally play it safe but to take the high risk when the odds are in their favor.

## Structure

The Rules are divided in to logical sections that build on each other. Additionally, the Rules section is supplied with a general Glossary for quick reference source. The main rules sections are [Card Reference](/rules/card_reference/index), Gameplay and Game Modes, and -- despite the interlinked wiki nature of the rulebook -- are recommended to be read in the given order on the first time.

[Card Reference](/rules/card_reference/index) introduces the Players to how Dragon's Money Laundering handles the cards of a regular playing cards deck in its own unique way.

[Gameplay](/rules/gameplay/index) utilizes the keywords introduced in Card Reference and outlines a repeatable flowchart-like process. By following these sequences to the point, anyone can start playing Dragon's Money Laundering immediately.

After the Players have a firm grasp of the Card Reference and Gameplay sections they can expand on it by reading about [Game Modes](/rules/game_modes/index). Game Modes modify the Core Rules to fit in to different situations such as playing with newbies and also 2-player games.

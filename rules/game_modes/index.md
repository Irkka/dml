# Game Modes

Dragon's Money Laundering is aiming to be a highly adaptible game engine that can accommodate all flavors of Players. Even though the Core Rules are  primarily created for hardcore board-/cardgamers by making a few tweaks the game complexity can be adjusted for teaching purposes.

## Quickstart

Quickstart rules teach the basic Market Place and Global Event mechanics in a game that works in an on itself. Basically, it's the Full Game without Character and Emblem card classes, Dragon's Nest and Dragon's Hoard Game Zones and Black Markets. It's a perfect solution to teach the game in bite-size chunks. When the Players are done learning the core mechanics, it's time to unleash the dragons and the characters.

## Full Game

Dragon's Money Laundering as it was intended and exactly as written in this Master Rules Wiki's Rules section.

## 2-player Game

Dragon's Money Laundering is meant to be played with 3-4 Players, but however it works also with only 2 Players. This requires a few slight changes to the Core Rules, though.

## Extended Rules

# Setup Stage

Setup Stage encompasses everything the Players need to do before starting a game of Dragon's Money Laundering. After executing the Setup Sequence properly everything is ready to loop through the sequences established in the Game Stage.

## Setup Sequence

1. Resolve which Player obtains the Initiative Badge according to the Initiative Badge Roll-Off rule.
2. Extract all Merchant Kings, all Resources of Face Value of 2 or 3 and Dragon Egg cards from the Event Deck.
3. Place all four Dragon Eggs into the Dragon's Nest.
4. Randomly stack all twos and threes extracted from the Event Deck into four face-down piles consisting of a one 2 and a one 3 each. 
5. Randomly allocate one face down Merchant King to each Player starting counter-clockwise with the Player who has the Initiative Badge.
6. Starting counter-clockwise from the Player with the Initiative Badge each Player may choose one of the Resource piles of twos and threes, and put it into their Treasury.
7. Draw cards from the Global Event Deck according to Restock Rule as explained in Turn Sequence. 

## Specific Rules

### Initiative Badge Roll-Off

The Player that happens to have the dice starts the roll-off in counter-clockwise order. The Player that rolls the highest result with two dice gets the Initiative Badge.

If any number of Players are tied for the highest result, they will repeat the roll-off until the Initiative Badge position is resolved.

If any Player rolls Dabo!, the Player may re-roll both the dice.

If any Player rolls 'Woot! Woot!', immediately interrupt Initiative Badge Roll-Off and that Player receives the Initiative Badge.

### Dealer Token Roll-Off

The Player who happens to have the dice starts the Dealer Token Roll-Off.

In counter-clockwise order each Player rolls the dice and the highest result is awarded the Dealer Token. In case of tied results, the process is repeated until the a definite result is attained.

If a Player rolls 'Dabo!', the Player may re-roll the dice.

If a Player rolls 'Woot!', that Player is immediately awarded the Dealer Token and the Dealer Token Roll-Off ends.

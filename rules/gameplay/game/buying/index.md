# Buying ⛂⛃⛂

Buying Commodities and taking over opponents' Emblems are the two main activities of the game.

The act of Buying is modelled by rolling two dice against a target Value. If the dice result is equal to or exceeds the target Value, the Player gets the Commodities or the Emblem in their Hand. Otherwise, nothing happens.

Buying is divided into three sequential Phases: Declaration, Seize Opportunity and Resolution.

## Commiting Commodities

Players can adjust the Value they have to roll against by commiting Commodities from their Hand into the Marketplace. All commited Commodities are lost after the Buying process has resolved.

## Sequence

1. Declaration
2. Seize
3. Resolution

### Declaration

The Active Player has to first declare to everyone what Commodities or Emblems they're attempting to acquire. That Player separates those cards from their Stocks or opponent's Front and places them visible to everyone. This is called a Declaration and its Value is the sum of the Value attributes of the cards it consists of.

By default the Declaration's Value must not exceed 12; a Player needs to be able to roll the number with two dice. However, if the Declaration's Value does exceed 12, the Player has to adjust the Value by placing appropriate Buying Commodities from their Hand next to the declared cards. By commiting Buying Commodities this way, the total Value of the Declaration is decreased. If the total Value of the Declaration doesn't now exceed 12, it's considered valid.

The Active Player may commit Commodities even though the initial Declaration's Value didn't exceed 12. This is also the only time an Active Player may adjust the Declaration's Value in case no opponent is awarded a Seize opportunity.

A Player may place any number of Buying Commodities in order to adjust the total Value of the Declaration.

A Declaration's Value can be modified in many ways even before paying any Buying Commodities. Some Events can make certain Commodities cheaper or more expensive and all Emblems provide a flat reduction to a Declaration's Value of their respective Commodity suit. Notably, the Emblems only reduce the Declaration's Value once, but the Events adjust the Values of each Commodity separately.

### Seize

After the Active Player has announced a Declaration each Passive Player now has the opportunity to Seize the Commodities from under the Active Player's nose. The act of Seizing happens by adjusting the Declaration's Value upwards, thus making it more difficult for the Active Player to roll that result.

Seize opportunity is awarded to the Passive Player who commits the largest total Value of Buying Commodities for the Declaration. A Passive Player may commit multiple Commodities at once.

A Passive Player may only commit Buying Commodities.

If a Passive Player is awarded the opportunity to Seize, they and the Active Player proceed to Resolution Phase together.

The Passive Player who was awarded the Seize opportunity loses their commited Commodity regardless of the outcome of the Resolution.

#### Sequence

1. Starting counter-clockwise from the Active Player, each Player may put a face-down card next to the Declaration. All Passive Players have the option to simply pass the opportunity.
2. After all Passive Players have either put a card down or passed their Seize opportunity, they all reveal their cards simultaneously.
3. The Player with the Buying Resources of the highest total Value is awarded the Seize opportunity. Other Passive Players return their cards to their Hands.

### Resolution

Before finally resolving the Declaration its Value can still be subject to change before the actual rolling happens.

#### No Seize opportunities awarded

If no Seize opportunities were awarded, the Active Player simply rolls against the total Value of the Declaration. Notably, the Active Player may not adjust the Value of the Declaration anymore, if all Passive Players passed on the Seize opportunity.

#### Seize attempt was awarded to an opponent

If a Seize opportunity was awarded to a Passive Player, that Passive Player then commits to the Marketplace the Commodity that they put down during the Seize Phase. The Declaration's Value is thus increased by the Value of the committed Commodity.

The Active Player and the Passive Player then take turns committing zero or more Buying Commodities to the Marketplace. Each time a new Buying Commodity is commited it either decreases(Active Player) or increases(Passive Player) the Declaration's Value.

Players can commit multiple cards in one go.

The Declaration's Value can become either a negative number or greater than 12. However, 'Wyvern Eyes' and 'Woot!' rolls will fail and succeed respectively regardless of the Declaration's final Value.

The Active Player has an inherent edge over the Passive Players when Buying. The Passive Players may only utilize the Buying Commodity of the Declaration. However, the Active Player can nullify the Passive Player's commited Buying Commodities with the so called Secondary Buying Commodity. In addition to the Buying Commodity of the Declaration, the Active Player may also commit the Declaration's Secondary Buying Commodity. However, the Secondary Buying Commodity never lowers the Declaration's Value directly, it only cancels out the Passive Player's commited Buying Commodities.

As soon as one of the Players passes their turn to commit, the Active Player moves to Roll action.

#### Roll

Resolving a Declaration boils down to rolling the dice. 

If the Active Player's roll result is equal to or exceeds the the total adjusted Value of the Declaration, the Active Player puts the cards of the Declaration into their Hand.

If the Active Player's roll result is less than the total adjusted Value of the Declaration, there can be two possible outcomes. If no Seize opportunities were awarded, the Declaration's cards are returned to the Marketplace by the Dealer. However, If a Seize opportunity was awarded, the Passive Player puts the cards of the Declaration into their Hand instead.

In each case all commited Buying Commodities are then placed to their matching Stocks in the Marketplace by the Dealer.

#### Sequence

1. The Dealer checks, if a Seize opportunity was awarded
	1.a. If no Seize opportunity was awarded, the Active Player proceeds to step 3
	1.b. If a Seize opportunity was awarded, continue to step 2
2. The Active Player and the Passive Player take turns commiting Buying Commodities and Secondary Buying Commodities. When one of the Players passes, continue to step 3
3. The Active Player rolls the dice against the Declaration's adjusted Value

# Acquisition Attempt Phase

Dragon's Money Laundering is all about acquiring goods. An Acquisition Attempt is declared, when an Active Player wants to buy certain Resources from the Marketplace, take over Emblems or go for contraband from Black Markets.

Each Acquisition Attempt comprises of a Target Value and a dice roll.

The Target Value is the minimum result the Player has to roll on two dice in order for the Acquisition Attempt to be successful. The Target Value of an Acquisition Attempt is the combined Face Values of the Resources/Emblems selected by the Active Player with Event modifiers applied. The Active Player has to roll equal to or more than the Target Value in order to obtain the desired Resources. The exceptions are 'Woot! Woot!' succeeding and 'Wyvern Eyes' failing automatically regardless of the Target Value.

The Target Value can be modified in many ways. Events and bid Primary and Secondary Buying Resources alter the number the Active Player has to roll. The Active Player and Passive Players have a chance to add negative and/or positive modifiers to the Target Value.

## Acquisition Attempt Sequence

1. Declaration Action
2. ( Seize Attempt Phase )
3. Bidding Phase
4. Resolution Step

### Declaration Action

Active Player chooses any number of Resources from any one Stock in the Marketplace, a Black Market Stock, or one Emblem another Player controls. The Player then places their selection in front of oneself.

The Target Value must be less than or equal to 12 at this point. During Declaration the Active Player may however bid any number of Primary Buying Resources to adjust the Target Value to equal 12 or less.

#### Black Market

Acquisition Attempts that target Black Market Stocks are slightly different from regular Acquisition Attempts.

Black Market Acquisition Attempts do not provoke Seize Attempts.

The default Target Value of any Black Market is 7 and it can't be modified, because they have no Resource Type.

If the Active Player succeeds at the Acquisition Attempt, the Active Player may take one card at random from the chosen Black Market.

### Resolution Step

The Players calculate all Primary and Secondary Buying Resources bid to the Acquisition Attempt and apply their modifiers to the Target Value.

The Active Player rolls 2D6. If the result is the same or higher as the Target Value, the Active Player puts the Resources or the Emblem into one's own Treasury.

However, if the Active Player fails the roll, then any player who was awarded a Seize Attempt will get the Resources. If no Seize Attempts were made, and the roll still fails, the Resources or Emblems are put back to their origin Zone.

Any Primary or Secondary Buying Resources bid during the Acquisition Attempt are placed to the Marketplace in their respective Stocks.

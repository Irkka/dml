# Seize Attempt Phase

Every Acquisition Attempt towards Stocks on the Marketplace provoke opportunities for Seize Attempts. Seize Attempts are actions that Passive Players can declare against the declared Acquisition Attempt.

The Player who's awarded the Seize Attempt can join in the Bidding Phase of the Acquisition Attempt as explained in its sequence.

## Seize Attempt Sequence

1. Starting counter-clockwise with the next Player from the Active Player, each Player may put a face-down card next to the declared Acquisition Attempt. If a Player wishes to forfeit their opportunity, they can simply pass on their turn.
2. After all Seize Attempt cards are laid down the Players reveal them simultaneously.
3. The Player with the highest card of the appropriate Resource Type(Primary Buying Resource) gets awarded the Seize Attempt. Furthermore, if no Player bid any Primary Buying Resources, no one gets the Seize Attempt. Each other Player retrieves their cards back to their Treasuries.

### N.B.

Skullduggery and bluffing is highly encouraged during Seize Attempts.

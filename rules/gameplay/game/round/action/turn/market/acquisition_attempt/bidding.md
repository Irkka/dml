# Bidding Phase

The Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt can be modified positively or negatively, thus making it easier or more difficult to roll on two dice. In order to make dice rolling easier the Active Player can modify the Target Value of an Acquisition Attempt. Each Resource Type has a one Primary Buying Resource that enables this modification. Together the Resource Types and Primary Buying Resources form a Wheel of Profit, which is a cyclical structure that appoints one unique Primary Buying Resource per Resource Type.

The Active Player may bid any number of Primary Buying Resources from his/her Treasury to aid his/her chances to acquire the desired set of Resources, or to proceed with the Acquisition Attempt without modifying the Target Value

Seize Attempts enable one Passive Player to bid appropriate Primary Buying Resources to make the dice rolling more difficult. The only difference is that each Primary Buying Resource bid by the Player performing a Seize Attempt would increase the Target Value by the Primary Buying Resource's Face Value.

Even though the Active Player may play further Primary Buying Resources to modify the Target Value in response to a Seize Attempt, the Seize Attempts introduce another key concept called: Secondary Buying Resource. Secondary Buying Resources are used by the Active Player to nullify the Primary Buying Resource played by the Passive Player. Secondary Buying Resources are placed next to the Passive Player's bid Primary Buying Resources, and they'll reduce the Primary Buying Resources Face Values according to their own Face Values. However, they can not make those Face Values negative, so Secondary Buying Resources can't modify the Target Value directly, but only affect the Passive Player's Primary Buying Resources.

## Bidding Sequence

Bidding Sequence is repeated until a breaking trigger.

0. ( If no one has been awarded a Seize Attempt, break Bidding Sequence )
1. Active Player's Bid Action
2. Passive Player's Bid Action

### Bid Action

The Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt can be modified by increasing or decreasing it, thus making it easier or more difficult to roll on two dice.

The Active Player may bid any number of Primary Buying Resources next to the Acquisition Attempt Resources. The Target Value is thus decreased by the Face Values of those bid cards.

Alternatively, the Active Player may bid any number of Secondary Buying Resources next to the cards bid by the Player with the Seize Attempt. The total sum of Face Values of those cards is decreased by the Face Values of the Secondary Buying Resources. However, this value can't be decreased below 0 at any times, even if the Secondary Buying Resource's Face Values are higher than the Passive Player's bid Primary Buying Resources.

Whenever a Player forfeits one's Bid Action it immediately breaks Bidding Sequence and shifts the Acquisition Attempt Sequence to Resolution Step. Players can't increase their bids unless someone else has bid something first.

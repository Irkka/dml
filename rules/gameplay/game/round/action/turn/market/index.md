# Market Phase

Market Phase is when the Active Player gets to perform actions and Passive Players get to react to them.

By default each Player has a one Market Action and a one Black Market Action per Turn. This number, however, can be modified by many in-game methods.

## Market Sequence

0. (Any extra Market Actions granted by rules)
1. Market Action
2. Black Market Action

### Market Action

Market Action is the standard method of interaction with the game. It allows Players to declare Acquisition Attempts on any available Stock or Emblem.

The Active Player may choose to substitute a Market Action for a Black Market Action. The substitution can be declared at any time before an Acquisition Attempt is declared and for each Market Action separately. However, all actions resolve in the given order of the Market Sequence.

### Black Market Action

Black Market Action is a minor action compared to a regular Market Action. It allows Players to declare Acquisition Attempts only to Black Market Stocks.

The Active Player may choose to forfeit one's Black Market Action.

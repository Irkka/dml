### Restock Phase

The Marketplace must have at least 3 Resource cards at the Restock step of each Turn.

If there are less than 3 valid Resource cards in the Marketplace during Restock, the dealer draws cards from the Event Deck until at least 3 Resource cards are in the Market Place. If the dealer can't draw cards, because the deck is depleted, the Turn ends and the missing cards are ignored.

Foreign Merchant cards will interrupt the Restock Step and resolve immediately. Restock routine is then continued normally.

All other cards of non-Resource types are put to the Dragon's Hoard.

#### Restock Sequence

1. Check the amount of Resource cards in the Marketplace
  1.a Number of cards equal to or more than 3. End Turn.
  1.b Number of cards less than 3. Continue Restock Sequence.
2. Draw cards from the Event Deck until there are three cards in the Marketplace.
  2.a If there are no cards in the Event Deck left. End Turn.

# Action Phase

Each Round the Players get to perform various actions during the Action Phase.

Once a Round the Players have an Active Turn when the Players declare their Market and Black Market actions. Conversely, each Player has multiple Passive Turns when the Player can react to other Players actions. The Player executing the Turn Sequence is considered the Active Player. Subsequently, each other Player is considered a Passive Player.

Before, after and between each Turn there's a Character Power Phase. During the Character Power Phase the Players can play Character Powers or Emblems.

# Black Market

Acquisition Attempts that target Black Market Stocks are slightly different from regular Acquisition Attempts.

## Black Market Sequence

The default Target Value of any Black Market is 7.

1. The Active Player chooses a Black Market
2. The Active Player may choose to declare a modifier no greater than the number of cards in the Active Player's Treasury
3. The Active Player rolls 2D6 against the Black Market Target Value
  * If the Active Player succeeds, the Active Player may take one card at random from the chosen Black Market. If the Active Player declared a modifier, the Active Player has to put that many cards of his/her choice in to the Black Market excluding the card the Active Player was awarded from that Black Market
  * If the Active Player fails, the Active Player is awarded no card and has to put cards equal to the declared modifier number at random from his/her Treasury in to the chosen Black Market

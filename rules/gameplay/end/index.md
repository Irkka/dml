# End Stage

The game can end in three different ways that indicate the method of deciding the winner. When starting the End Stage, the key is to determine what triggered it.

## End Sequence

1. Determine what triggered End Stage
2. Follow the appropriate sequence
  a. If the game ended due to drawing from an empty Global Event Deck, proceed with Victory Point Sequence
  b.  If the game ended due to a Player achieving Monopoly victory condition, proceed with Monopoly Sequence
  c. If the game ended due to a Player achieving the Ultimate Victory victory condition, proceed with Ultimate Victory Sequence

### Victory Point Sequence

1. Remove all non-Resource and non-Dragon Egg cards from Players' Treasuries and Emblem Zones
2. Using the remaining cards in Treasuries and Emblem Zones calculate the total Victory Points achieved by each Player separately. Apply modifiers and bonuses accordingly
3. The Player with the most Victory Points is declared winner. In the case of a tie no one wins

### Monopoly Sequence

1. Verify the Treasury of the Player that declared Monopoly
2. The Player that achieved Monopoly victory condition is declared winner

### Ultimate Victory Sequence

1. Verify the Treasury of the Player that declared Ultimate Victory
2. The Player that achieved Ultimate Victory victory condition is declared winner

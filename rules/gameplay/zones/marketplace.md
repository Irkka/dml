# Marketplace

Marketplace is where Resources drawn from the Global Event Deck are placed. Each Resource Type is arranged to its own Stock and the four Stocks are arranged to form a row that is equivalent to the clockwise Wheel of Profit. This makes it easier for Players to see the necessary Primary Buying Resource just by looking at the Marketplace arrangement.

## Location

Marketplace resides in the middle of the table.

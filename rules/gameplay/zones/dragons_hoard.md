# Dragon's Hoard

Due to the limited amount of cards available, they need to be recycled. Dragon's Hoard Zone is basically a discard pile with a single distinctive trait: the cards are still in the game as opposed to Exile Zone. Thus discarded cards can be brought back to the game as Resource and Character cards available to Players. 

## Location

It is a face-up pile of cards next to the Global Event Deck and Dragon's Nest, diagonally opposite to the Active Global Event Zone.

## N.B.

The topmost card of the Dragon's Hoard is open information, but Players need to keep track of cards that go in there. They have the right to see everything that goes in to the Dragon's Hoard and in what order, but they can't double check this information once the triggering discard procedure is complete.

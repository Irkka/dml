# Exile

Exile is the true discard pile. Cards that enter Exile can't be returned to the game by any means.

## Location

Exile should be located in a safe place where no unsuspecting oaf can have access to the cards and accidentally reveal their nature.

## N.B.

Any non-implicit information about cards in Exile are off-limits to all Players. For example, Players know which Character cards have been moved there after their Character Ultimate Powers have resolved, but in a 3-player game the Players may not verify the missing Merchant Kings identity, when the card is put face down in to Exile.

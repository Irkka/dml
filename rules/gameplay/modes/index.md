# Modes

Dragon's Money Laundering engine can accommodate different variations of the game. Modes modify the rules to fit different situations, e.g. playing with 3 players.

## Full Game

A 4-Player game by the rules written in this document. Dragon's Money Laundering as it was intended.

## 3-Player Smackdown

The game plays exactly as the Full Game, except during the Setup the undealt Merchant King is put face down into Exile, and the undealt starting Commodities are put to the Discard Pile. Players can't unlock any achievements from 3-Player Smackdown.

## Market Mayhem(Quickstart)

Learning Dragon's Money Laundering in one sitting can be a daunting undertaking. Market Mayhem is the perfect 'summer cottage' version of Dragon's Money Laundering. The Quickstart rules teach the basic Marketplace and Event mechanics.

Quickstart Deck consists only of Merchant Kings and Commodities.

Quickstart game removes the following elements from the game:

* Discard Pile
* Dragon Eggs
* Black Markets
* Wyvern Eyes and Woot! effects beyond instant failure and success
* Character cards, and Emblem functionality from Guilds
* Player Effects of Events

When the Players are done learning the core mechanics, it's time to unleash the dragons and the characters in the Full Game!

## I See Fire

I See Fire mode is aimed at hardened DML Players. It introduces new mechanics that make the game even more punishing.

### Hustled!

If a Player fails a Visit Black Market roll, they lose a randomly picked card from their Hand into the selected Black Market.

### I See Fire

If a Player has any Dragon Eggs in their Hand and insufficient Shield Vantage Bonuses during a Dragon Siege, that Player's Merchant King is put face down into Exile and all their Commodities are put into the Discard Pile. That Player is then removed from the game.

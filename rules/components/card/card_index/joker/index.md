# Jokers

## 🃟 Foreign Merchant - Global Event

If a Joker is drawn at any time from the Global Event Deck it is shuffled with the Dragon's Hoard and a Dragon's Egg from the Dragon's Nest – if available – and then placed to the Market Place as a new separate Black Market.

## 🃏 Thief - Character

**High risk, but the prize.**

Victory Points: -

Character Ultimate Power: The Player may take one card at random from any Player's Treasury and put it into their own Treasury. Alternatively the Player may put any card from his/her Treasury to any other Player's Treasury. 

If the Thief resolves, instead of being exiled the Player rolls 2D6 against a Target Value of 7. If the roll succeeds at beating the Target Value the Thief is shuffled back in to the Global Event Deck. Otherwise, the Thief card is placed into Exile.

# Kings – Merchant King

The heads of each of the four kingdoms in the realm. Each of whom are constantly trying to outwit the others in the market places of Four Corners, the commercial hub of the realm. Each Merchant King has a burning – yet secret – desire for a certain type of Resource, which yields them even greater profits.

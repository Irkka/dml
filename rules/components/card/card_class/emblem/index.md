# Emblem

Emblems are public displays of economical power. They grant their owners significant advantage on business opportunities.

An Emblem card can be played from the owning Player's Treasury into the Emblem Zone during the Character Ultimate Power Phase. It is declared to be an Emblem before placing it on to the Character Ultimate Power Stack.

The Emblem can't be withdrawn from the Emblem Zone by the owning Player.

Character Ultimate Powers can't be activated by cards played as an Emblem.

## Attributes

### Face Value as a played Emblem

Any Player may declare an Acquisition Attempt on any one Emblem card played in an Emblem Zone.

All Emblems have Face Value of 10 and their Resource Type is the printed suite on the card. The Acquisition Attempt is resolved as explained in the Gameplay section.

### Buying Bonus

Each Emblem has an Buying Bonus attribute. The Buying Bonus attribute is subtracted from the Target Value of any Acquisition Attempt of the corresponding Resource Type as the Emblem itself. These bonuses stack with each other.

### Vantage Bonus

Each Resource Type has a shared Vantage Bonus. Anytime Players play any one of the three possible Emblems of a suite, they'll receive the same stacking bonus.

The possible Vantage Bonuses are:

* Dragon Shield
* hearts
* diamonds
* clubs

#### Tens and Jacks

Tens and Jacks provide an Buying Bonus of 1 on their corresponding Resource Type.

#### Queens

Queens provide an Buying Bonus of 2 on their corresponding Resource Type.

## N.B.

The Emblem card has to be played into the Emblem Zone before the owning Player can utilize its Buying Bonus or Vantage Bonus attributes.

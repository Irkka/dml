# Card Reference

This rules section explains all the different Card Classes and their possible subclasses. Additionally, there is a Card Index that takes these Card Classes and assigns them to each respective cards of the deck. Card Index also lists all the values of card specific attributes and as such is the primary source of reference after a Player has firmly grasped the concept and content of Card Classes.

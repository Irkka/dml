# Class reference

A card Class tells how a card can be used throughout the game. Each card has one or more classes assigned to it.

In gameplay situations the rules reference different card classes. If one of the selected card's classes match the rule, then the rule can be applied to it. Please, refer to the Card Reference whenever you need to check any card's classes.

Some classes may grant a card additional attributes, e.g. Vantage Bonus for being an Emblem. All of those attributes and their specific values are listed in the Card Reference section.

## Class definitions

A card can have different combinations of the following classes.

* Commodity
* Dragon Egg
* Emblem
* Foreign Merchant
* Guild
* Merchant King
* Power

### Commodity

Commodities are things you can trade at the Four Corners Marketplace. In a game of capitalism, the winner is usually the one with the most Commodities at the end.

There are four types of Commodities:

* Iron ‚Äì Spades
* Wood ‚Äì¬†Clubs
* Slaves ‚Äì¬†Hearts
* Spice ‚Äì¬†Diamonds

#### Attributes

##### Value

The Commodity card's Value is the printed number of the card itself, thus possible Values range from 2 to 10. The higher the number the more difficult the Commodity is to acquire.

##### Victory Points

Each Commodity yields Victory Points equal to its Value attribute at the end of the game.

Merchant King's Desired Commodity attribute doubles the amount of Victory Points from matching Commodities.

### Dragon Egg

A Dragon Egg is an exotic contraband that can only be bought from the Black Markets. They're highly sought after, yet equally highly dangerous to hold on to.

Whenever a Dragon Egg would be put anywhere else than the Dragon's Nest or a Player's Hand, put it in the Dragon's Nest instead.

A Dragon Egg is different from a Commodity. It has no Commodity type and thus isn't eligible for Merchant King's Desired Commodity bonus at the end of the game.

#### Attributes

##### Victory Points

Each Dragon Egg yields a flat 20 Victory Points at the end of the game.

### Emblem

Emblems are public displays of economical power. They grant their owners significant advantage on business opportunities, but they can be seized or bribed by the competing Merchant Kings.

During the Power phase, an Emblem card can be played in Front of the Player from its owner's Hand.

Emblems have to be played in Front of the Player to gain the Buying Bonus and Vantage Bonus effects.

Emblems have a Commodity type that's indicated by its suit. Other Players may declare Acquisition Attempts on Emblems played in Front of their opponents.

## Attributes

### Value

Each Emblem has a fixed Value attribute of 10 when played in Front of the Player.

### Buying Bonus

Each Emblem has a Buying Bonus attribute. The Buying Bonus attribute is subtracted from the Target Value of any Acquisition Attempt of the same Commodity suit as the Emblem itself. Buying Bonuses stack with each other.

#### Tens and Jacks

Tens and Jacks provide a Buying Bonus of 1 on their corresponding Commodity suit.

#### Queens

Queens provide a Buying Bonus of 2 on their corresponding Commodity suit.

### Vantage Bonus

Each suit has a shared Vantage Bonus. Vantage Bonuses stack with each other.

The possible Vantage Bonuses are:

* Shield ‚Äì Spades
* Tribute ‚Äì Wood
* Permission ‚Äì¬†Hearts
* Fortune ‚Äì¬†Diamonds

### üÉè,üÉü Foreign Merchant

Foreign Merchants are mysterious figures that skulk the side alleys of Four Corners.

#### Special

Whenever a Foreign Merchant is drawn from the Deck, immediately Establish a Black Market.

### Guild

Guilds are the trade-hubs of their respective Commodities. They boost the Victory Points of matching Commodities at the end of the game.

#### Attributes

##### Commodity Bonus

Each Guild provides a flat 2 Victory Point bonus for each non-Guild Commodity in the owning Player's Hand that matches the Guild's suit. The Commodity Bonus is not doubled by the Merchant King's Desired Commodity attribute.

##### Event

All Guilds share a special Event type: Grand Opening, which supersedes any other Event types inherited from Commodity types.

### Merchant King

Merchant Kings represent the Players themselves in the city of Four Corners and the in-game world. Each Merchant King has a Desired Commodity attribute that indicates which Commodity type yields double the Victory Points at the end of the game.

Merchant Kings are hidden knowledge throughout the game. Only the Player knows their own Desired Resource.

#### Attributes

##### Desired Commodity

Merchant King's Desired Commodity is same as the printed suit on the card. Therefore, possible Desired Commodities are: Iron, Wood, Slaves and Spice.

### Character

Character cards represent powerful allies of the Merchant Kings. They can be various city officials, powerful nobles or shady thieves that might help a Merchant King to gain the upper hand. Each Character has a specific Power attribute that can be activated once a game, after which the Character card is put to Exile.

Powers can be played only during the Power phase and only from the Player's Hand.

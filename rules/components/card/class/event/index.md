# Global Event

Global Event cards model the shifting and unpredictable economical and sociopolitical climate in Four Corners. Global Event cards modify game Rounds in unpredictable ways and give advantage to different Players. Taking the risks at the right time, when others can't react to them is a key ability of any Player.

Each Global Event Type has two distinct effect attributes: a Player Effect and a Market Effect. Player Effects favor Player's with less cards in their Treasury and gives them better chance at getting back in to the game, whereas Market Effects can manipulate Face Values of individual cards or make Acquisition Attempts safer or more difficult to execute.

Player Effects are structured as follows:

1. The Global Event card states what effect applies on each Player
2. Any Player that has less cards than the current Global Event Face Value ignores the Player Effect

Market Effects are structured as follows:

1. The Global Event card states what effect is applied on the Resource cards in play.
2. Each Global Event Type has a unique effect, but the range is always inclusive to the Global Event Face Value. The Global Event affects Resource cards with Face Value less or more than -- depending on the Global Event Type --, or equal to the Global Event Face Value.

Player Effect resolves selectively, Market Effect is unconditional to all Players.

Player Effects resolve at the start of the Round and their effects last until the end of the Round, regardless if Players' Treasury sizes change.

# Event

Events model the shifting and unpredictable economical and sociopolitical climate in Four Corners. Each Event modifies a single Round of game in unpredictable ways and gives advantage to Players with fewer cards in their Hands.

Each Event type has two distinct effects: a Player Effect and a Market Effect. Player Effects favor Players with less cards in their Hands, whereas Market Effects temporarily change buying mechanics of the game for each Player equally. Player Effect resolves selectively, Market Effect is unconditional to all Players.

## Player Effect

If the number of cards in a Player's Hand is more than or equal to the Event cards Value, they suffer the effect.

Player Effects resolve at the start of the Round and their effects last until the end of the Round, regardless if the affected Player's Hand size changes.

## Market Effect

Market Effects are structured as follows:

1. Event card's type states what effect is applied to the Commodity cards in the Marketplace
2. Event card's Value attribute is then compared to each Commodity in the Marketplace or those that enter the Marketplace that Round

Market Effects are static and are continuously checked.

## Suit

Each of the four Commodity suits has a corresponding Event type; the Event type is indicated by the printed suit of the card. Additionally, there are two special Event types for Guilds and Character cards that have no Market Effects.

The different Event types are:

* FCCC Regulations – Spades
* The Hated People – Clubs
* Decadence – Hearts
* Tax Relief – Diamonds
* Carnival of Coin – Character
* Grand Opening – Guild

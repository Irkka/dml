# Marketplace

Marketplace is where Resources drawn from the Event Deck are placed and Black Markets are created.

## Pro Tip

Memorizing the Wheel of Profit can be difficult. To easily see which Resource is the Primary Buying Resource of any other given Resource Type, arrange Resource Stocks according to the Wheel of Profit from left to right starting from the Slaves. The Primary Buying Resource is thus the one on the left of the Stock.

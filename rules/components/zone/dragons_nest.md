# Dragon's Nest

Dragon Egg cards are not directly available to the Players' actions. However, different game events may lead to Dragon Egg cards leaving Dragon's Nest.

## Location

It is a face-down pile of cards next to Active Event and Dragon's Hoard diagonally opposite to Event Deck.

## N.B.

Dragon Egg cards are always returned to Dragon's Nest after Dragon Siege Sequence -- excluding the Dragon Eggs that are in Black Market Stocks.

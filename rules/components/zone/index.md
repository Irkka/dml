# Zones ⬚

The playing area consists of a table and the Players' hands. The table has been divided into Zones that represent different in-game locations where cards can be placed throughout the game. The Zone determines how a Player can interact with its contained cards.

Some Zones are personal to each Player, in which case each Player has their own version of the Zone with its unique state.

Please, refer to the Quick Reference sheet for the correct positions of the Zones on the table.

## Different types of knowledge

Zones may differ in terms of how their contents are revealed to the Players.

Each Zone has one of the following knowledge levels associated with it:

* Open 👀
* Implied ☛
* Hidden ⛔
* Private 👁

### Open 👀

Any Player may query this information and must be given the correct answer by the Dealer.

### Implied ☛

No Player may query this information, but the information has been revealed before it became hidden.

### Hidden ⛔

## Definitions

The playing area is divided into 8 types of Zones:

* Deck 🂠
* Current Event 🌐
* Discard Pile 🗑
* Dragon's Nest 🕱
* Marketplace 🗠
* Hand 🖐
* Front ⇲
* Exile ∅

### Deck 🂠

The Deck is a face down pile of cards in the side of the gaming area.

The Deck regulates how Characters, Commodities, Events and Foreign Merchants enter the game. It represents the unpredictable nature of the world and its randomness gives each game a unique rhythm.

After the Setup, the remaining unallocated cards constitute the initial contents of the Deck. At its creation it should contain only Character, Commodity and Foreign Merchant cards.

The contents of the Deck are hidden knowledge from all Players throughout the game.

### Current Event 🌐

The Current Event is a face up card next to the Deck.

The contents of the Current Event modify the gameplay for a single round. The Current Event represents the shifting sociopolitical situation within Four Corners and affects the commerce and the Players alike.

The Current Event may become empty due to various game mechanics. However, the Event type will stay the same as it was in the beginning of the Round until the end of the Round.

At the beginning of each new Round the Dealer puts the contents of the last Round's Current Event into the Discard Pile and draws a new Event card from the Deck. The Dealer then places the card face up into the area reserved for the Current Event and resolves the new Event's effects.

The contents of the Current Event are open knowledge.

### Discard Pile 🗑

The Discard Pile is a face up pile of cards next to the Deck.

The Discard Pile houses all the discarded Commodity and Character cards. It represents travelers from other parts of the realm and all kinds of foreign contraband that will be made available in future Black Markets.

Many rules can cause cards to be discarded. In each case the cards are put face up to the Discard Pile one at a time.

If a Dragon Egg is discarded, the Dealer puts it into the Dragon's Nest instead.

If a Thief is discarded, the Dealer shuffles it into the Deck instead.

The Discard Pile is implied knowledge, except for the top card that is open knowledge.

### Dragon's Nest 🕱

The Dragon's Nest is a face down pile of cards next to the Current Event and the Discard Pile.

The Dragon's Nest houses all the Dragon Egg cards. It represents a place where no one has any business being, but yet somehow once in a while a Foreign Merchant happens to get their hands on to one of its contents.

The amount of Dragon Eggs is implied knowledge; the pile contents are hidden, but the pile itself is visible. Players can't handle the cards unless otherwise instructed, but they can approximate the number of the Dragon Eggs in the pile.

Dragon Eggs are separated from the other playing cards and placed into the Dragon's Nest during the Setup.

### Marketplace 🗠

The Marketplace is the largest area in the middle of the table. It represents the main marketplace of Four Corners and is the hub of all action. All available Commodities and Black Markets are located there, excluding any Commodity cards that Players have played in Front of them.

The Marketplace is seeded by the Dealer, who draws cards from the Deck at various points in the game. The contents of the Marketplace change also when the Players commit Commodities from their Hand during Buying.

The Marketplace is further divided into four Stocks🗍 and any number of Black Markets🏮.

#### Stock 🗍

A Stock is a face up pile of cards in the Marketplace. Each card reveals the number and suit of the one below it and the cards are ordered from large(bottom) to small(top). The Stocks represent the merchants' available stores of Commodities at the Marketplace.

A single Stock can contain only Commodities that share a Commodity suit. Each Commodity suit thus has its own Stock in the Marketplace.

Stocks' contents are open knowledge to each Player.

#### Black Market 🏮

A Black Market is a face down pile of shuffled cards next to the Stocks in the Marketplace. Black Markets represent the contraband that's smuggled in the city from the Discard Pile.

Each time a new Black Market is established, the Dealer creates a separate Black Market pile from the former ones.

All Black Markets' contents are implied knowledge to each Player. Each Player has seen the contents of the Discard Pile before it becoming a Black Market.

### Hand 🖐

The Hand is a personal Zone to each individual Player. It can contain anything from Commodities to Characters to Dragon Eggs. It represents their Merchant King's personal treasury.

During Setup each Player is handed two Commodity cards – one of each: a two and a three of a random Commodity suit.

The Hand's contents are private knowledge and can't be shared with other Players. However, the number of cards in a Player's Hand is open knowledge.

### Front ⇲

The Front is the part of the table in front of the Player. It represents each Merchant King's public assets.

The Front is a personal Zone for each individual Player.

The Front is further divided into one obligatory face-down Merchant King and any number of Emblems.

#### Merchant King 👑

Merchant King is a single face down card that tells the Player their Desired Commodity suit. The Merchant Kings represent the Players themselves in the game world.

All Merchant Kings are private knowledge.

#### Emblems ⚜

An Emblem is a face-up card with the Emblem class. Players can play Emblem cards in Front of them to gain powerful bonuses or to hamper other Players. Emblems represent public displays of wealth and political power, and as such they command respect and certain privileges around Four Corners.

Emblems can be the targets of Buying Declarations by the owning Player's opponents.

All Emblems are open knowledge.

### Exile ∅

The Exile is a face-down pile next to the gaming area.

Whenever a Player expends the Power of a Character, that Character is put into Exile after resolving the Power.

No game mechanic can return cards from the Exile.

The Exile is implied knowledge.

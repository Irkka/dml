# Zones

The playing area of Dragon's Money Laundering consists of a table and the players' hands. The table has been divided into Zones that represent different in-game locations where cards can be placed throughout the game. A Zone determines how a Player can interact with its contained cards.

Some Zones are personal to each Player, in which case each Player has their own version of the Zone with its unique state.

Please, refer to the Quick Reference sheet for the correct positions of the Zones on the table.

## Types

The playing area in Dragon's Money Laundering is divided into 8 types of Zones:

* Deck
* Event
* Discard Pile
* Dragon's Nest
* Marketplace
* Hand
* Front
* Exile

## Definitions

### Deck

The Deck regulates how Events, Characters and Resources enter the game.

The contents of the Deck are hidden from all Players.

The remaining cards after the Game Setup form the initial contents of the Deck.

### Event

The contents of the Event modify the gameplay for a single round.

The contents of the Event are open knowledge.

At the beginning of each Round the Dealer puts the contents of the last Round's Event into the Discard Pile and resolves a new Event from the Deck.

### Discard Pile

Discard Pile houses all discarded Resources and Characters.

Each card that enters the Discard Pile is open knowledge; afterwards only the top card can be viewed.

Many rules can cause cards to be discarded. In each case the cards are put to the Discard Pile.

### Dragon's Nest

The Dragon's Nest houses all the Dragon Eggs.

The amount of Dragon Eggs is implied knowledge; the pile contents are hidden, but the pile itself is visible. Players can't handle the cards, but they can approximate the number of the Dragon Eggs in the pile.

Dragon Eggs are separated from the Deck during the Game Setup and then placed into the Dragon's Nest.

### Marketplace

The Marketplace houses all the Resources that can be bought during the Players' Turns and all potential Black Markets.

The Marketplace is further divided into Stocks and Black Markets. Stocks are open knowledge, whereas the contents of the Black Markets are hidden.

The Marketplace is seeded by drawing cards from the Deck or when the Players bid Resources to buy commodities.

### Hand

The Hand is a personal and private Zone for each individual Player. It can contain anything from Resources to Characters to Dragon Eggs.

The contents of the Hand are private and can't be shared with other Players. However, the number of cards in a Player's Hand is open knowledge.

During Game Setup each Player is handed two Resource cards â€“ one of each value: a two and a three of a random Resource type.

### Front

The Front is a personal Zone for each individual Player. It can contain any number of Emblem cards and a single obligatory face-down Merchant King.

The contents of each Player's Front is open knowledge with the exception of the Merchant King.

Players can play Emblem cards in Front of them to gain powerful bonuses or to hamper other Players.

### Exile

The Exile is a Zone where cards are put when they're removed from the game.

Each card that enters Exile is open knowledge. However, the cards are placed face-down into Exile and can't be viewed afterwards.

Whenever a Player expends the Power of a Character, the Character is put into Exile after resolving that Power.

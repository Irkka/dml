# Stack

Stack zone exists only during Character Power Phases of the Rounds. Stack records the order in which the Character Powers or Emblems have been played. Stack then resolves in reverse order; it is basically a LIFO(Last-in-First-out) data structure.

## Location

It can be located at any convenient spot on the table.

## Pro Tip

To distinguish between played Emblem and Character Powers on the Stack, place the Emblems perpendicular -- so that they form a right angle -- to Character Powers. This is important when there are more than one card on the Stack and remembering which one was an Emblem and which a Power becomes more challenging.

## N.B.

Only cards with the classes Character or Emblem can be played on the Character Ultimate Power Stack.

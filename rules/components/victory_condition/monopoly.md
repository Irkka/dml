# Monopoly

If at any point in the game a Player's Treasury has all the Resource cards from 2 to 9 of the same Resource Type, that Player can immediately declare a Monopoly. The Resource Type can be any of the four basic Resource Types.

When a Monopoly is declared the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. For example, the Player can't lose those cards, because of a Character Ultimate Power waiting to resolve.

Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved Monopoly will be declared winner.

## N.B.

A Monopoly doesn't require a Guild House; tens are excluded.

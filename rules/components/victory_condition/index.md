# Victory Conditions ✌

There are many ways to win a game of Dragon's Money Laundering. All of them require greed and cunning.

## Victory Points

The game comes to a natural end when the Dealer attempts to draw an Event card from a depleted Deck. 

At this point the Players reveal their Merchant King cards – and thus their Secret Desired Resource –, after which the Players remove all non-Resource or non-Dragon Egg cards from their Hands and Fronts. Those cards yield no Victory Points.

First the Players apply their Secret Desired Resource modifiers and Guild Bonuses, and then tally their Victory Point totals from the remaining Resource and Dragon Egg cards. This includes any Guilds played in Front of the Player.

The Player with the highest score will be declared winner.

### Ties

If two or more Players have the exact same Victory Point total, the Player with more Dragon Eggs is the winner. Furthermore, if the Players have an equal amount of Dragon Eggs in their Hand, no one wins.

### Victory Point Counting System

Counting Victory Points can be cumbersome without proper technique – a systematical approach is recommended. The following sequence is just an example, but the bottom line is that modifiers and bonuses should be applied on totals not individual cards.

1. Separate all different Resource Types in their own stacks
2. Add up each stack's total Face Values individually
  2.1 If the Resource Type matches the Secret Desired Resource, double the stack total at this point
3. Apply Guild Bonus on each applicable stack
4. Sum up each stack's total

## Monopoly

If at any point during the game a Player has all the Resource cards from 2 to 9 of the same type in their Hand, that Player may immediately declare a Monopoly. Notably, the Resources can be of any type as long as they all share that type. Also, Guilds are not required for declaring a Monopoly.

When a Monopoly is declared the Player reveals their Hand. If the Player indeed has Monopoly over a Resource, the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. All game sequences are terminated without resolving.

Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved Monopoly will be declared winner.

## Father of Dragons

If at any point during the game a Player has all four Dragon Eggs in their Hand, that Player may immediately declare themselves the Father of Dragons.

When a Father of Dragons is declared the Player reveals their Hand. If the Player indeed has four Dragon Eggs, the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. All game sequences are terminated without resolving.

Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved Father of Dragons will be declared winner.

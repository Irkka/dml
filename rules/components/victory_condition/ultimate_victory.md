# Ultimate Victory

If at any point in the game a Player's Treasury has all four Dragon Egg cards in it, that Player can immediately declare an Ultimate Victory.

When an Ultimate Victory is declared the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. For example, the Player can't lose those cards, because of a Character Ultimate Power waiting to resolve.

Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved the Ultimate Victory will be declared winner.

# ðŸ‚“ Woot! Woot!

Woot! Woot! is triggered when a Player rolls double sixes. Despite being a double, Woot! Woot! can't be re-rolled.

Woot! Woot! is an automatic success regardless of the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt. Additionally, any Woot! Woot! result will immediately trigger Foreign Merchant Sequence after the triggering action.

During the Initiative Badge Roll-Off any Player rolling Woot! Woot! will immediately be awarded the Initiative Badge and the remaining Players are denied the chance to roll for the Initiative Badge anymore.

It is customary to shout 'Woot! Woot!' and wave your hands above your head when Woot! Woot! is triggered.

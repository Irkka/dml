# Victory Condition

There are many ways to win a game of Dragon's Money Laundering. The game has been designed so that at no point can one be absolutely certain about one's victory. Even the Players that have lost everything at some point of the game have a slight chance at a comeback. Sometimes ruining someone else's game is as good a tactic as the other. Victory can and must be taken by any means necessary. There are no second places.

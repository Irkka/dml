# Victory Point

When the Global Event Deck is completely depleted and the Dealer must draw a new Active Global Event but is unable, the game ends.

At this point the Players reveal their Merchant King cards and thus their Secret Desired Resource.

Players remove all non-Resource and non-Dragon Egg cards from their Treasuries and Emblem Zones. They don't yield any Victory Points.

Players tally their Victory Points from Resource and Dragon Egg cards in their Treasury and Emblem Zones, apply their Merchant King's Secret Desired Resource modifiers and Guild House Resource Bonus Victory Points.

The Player with the highest score will be declared winner.

## Victory Point Counting System

Counting Victory Points incorrectly is time consuming and cumbersome to each Player involved. A systematical approach is recommended. The following sequence is just an example, but the bottom line is that modifiers and bonuses should be applied on totals not individual cards.

1. Separate all different Resource Types in their own stacks.
2. Add up each stack's total Face Values individually.
  2.1 If the Resource Type matches the Secret Desired Resource, double the stack total at this point.
3. Apply Resource Bonus on each applicable stack.
4. Sum up each stack's total.

# Guild House

A Guild House is the trading hub of its inherent Resource Type.

Guild Houses are truly game-winning cards. In tight games the cumulated Resource Bonus can become something of a tie-breaker or an additional point advantage in and on itself.

## Attributes

### Resource Bonus

The Guild House provides a Resource Bonus on cards matching its own Resource Type. Thus, possible Resource Bonus types are: Slaves, Spice, Iron and Wood.

Resource Bonus attribute provides 2 bonus Victory Points for each other card corresponding to the Guild House's Resource Type in the owning Player's Treasury at the End Stage of the game.

Points provided by Resource Bonus are not doubled by the Secret Desired Resource attribute of the controlling Player's Merchant King.

The Guild House itself doesn't receive the Resource Bonus.

# Card Classes

Each card in the deck has been assigned one or more classes. These classes define the interface how they can be used and in which Zones they can be played during gameplay.

In Dragon's Money Laundering classes are various sets of keywords attached to playing cards. Because regular playing cards have no method of conveying the class in textual form, the game requires Players to memorize what classes are assigned to which playing cards.

Each card has one or more classes attached to it that govern how their effects will resolve in different Zones. In gameplay situations the rules indicate which card class triggers the rule, or which card class can be played at the given time. If necessary, at those times the Player needs to refer to the Card Index and double-check the given card's inherent classes.

## Attributes

Classes grant attributes to the cards and the attributes can have unique values on specific cards. Card Index assigns these values and should be consulted during gameplay when the attribute values of a specific card are unclear.

## List of Card Classes

The possible Card Class tuples can be formed by using these base classes. If a rule matches any member of the class tuple of a card, it is triggered or the card is considered valid at that point.

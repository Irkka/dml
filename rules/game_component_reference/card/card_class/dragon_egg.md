# Dragon Egg

Dragon Egg is an exotic contraband that can only be bought from the Black Markets. They're highly sought after, yet equally highly dangerous to hold on to.

## Attributes

### Victory Points

A Dragon Egg card provides a flat 20 Victory Points each if a Player has one or more of them in one's Treasury at the End Stage of the game. 

*A Dragon Egg is not a Resource.* The Dragon Eggs have no Resource Type and thus won't receive the Secret Desired Resource Victory Point bonus at the end of the game.

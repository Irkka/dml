# Treasury

Treasury is equivalent to the Player's hand cards.

## Location

Treasury should be kept secret, there are no constraints about the location.

## N.B.

All non-implicit information about a Player's Treasury is secret information. Players can keep track of what Resources their opponents acquire from the Marketplace, or use deductive reasoning about what cards they might have in their Treasuries.

Players may also disclose all acquired information about any Player's Treasury to all opponents.

# Dice Roll

Dice rolling is used in three distinct sequences to settle the conditional nature of the outcome of specific actions. The first time is during the Setup Stage when deciding the starting controller of the Initiative Badge and it only happens once a game. Every other roll during the game is either to determine whether an Acquisition Attempt is successful or not, or whether the Thief is put to Exile or back to the Global Event Deck.

Dragon's Money Laundering rewards Players for rolling doubles, save rolling double ones. There are three categories of doubles and they all have different effects that trigger if they're rolled. The categories are:

* Dabo!
* Woot! Woot!
* Wyvern Eyes

Acquisition Attempt and Thief rolls can initiate game sequences that start immediately after resolving the triggering action.

Rolls during the Setup Stage of the game only grant re-rolls and instant successess.

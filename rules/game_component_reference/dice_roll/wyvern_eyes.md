# 🁫 Wyvern Eyes

Wyvern Eyes is triggered when a Player rolls double ones. Despite being a double, Wyvern Eyes can't be re-rolled.

Wyvern Eyes is an automatic failure regardless of the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt. Additionally, any Wyvern Eyes result will immediately trigger the Dragon Siege Sequence.

During the Initiative Badge Roll-Off, if each Player rolls Wyvern Eyes, they are thereby denied all access to this game until they learn how to roll dice properly.

Depending on the Player's situation, it is customary to groan in pain or snigger gleefully when Wyvern Eyes is triggered.

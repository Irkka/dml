# üÅ≥-üÇã Dabo!

Dabo! is triggered when a Player rolls double twos, threes, fours or fives. The triggering Player may immediately re-roll the dice in hope of a higher score. The Player may re-roll even if the initial roll would have failed or for that matter succeeded.

Dabo! can trigger during Initiative Badge Roll-Off or during the actual game during Acquisition Attempts. It may be used to achieve higher results on Initiative Badge Roll-Off, if the Player is not happy with the triggering roll. However, the Player has to keep the following non-Dabo! result even, if it's lower than the former roll. All subsequent Dabo! results naturally yield a new optional re-roll.

Dabo! can be used in many ways. Re-rolling successful Acquisition Attempts can be used to try force the probabilities on Wyvern Eyes or Woot! Woot! results.

It is customary to shout 'Dabo!' out loud, when Dabo! is triggered.

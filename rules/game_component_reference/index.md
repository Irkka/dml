# Game Component Reference

Dragon's Money Laundering is designed to work on minimal resources. Dice rolls, cards and sections of the playing table, called [Zones](/rules/game_component_reference/zone/index), all convey multiple meanings that interact with the rules sequences and each other. On the first read-through, players are encouraged to learn about these Game Components in the given order: [Zones](/rules/game_component_reference/zone/index), [Cards](/rules/game_component_reference/card/index) and [Dice Rolls](/rules/game_component_reference/dice_roll/index).

[Zones](/rules/game_component_reference/zone/index) indicate the parts of the gaming area that different rules apply to. They provide a well-defined interface to various player actions.

To squeeze out enough complexity out of limited amount of cards DML utilizes *polymorphism*. Basically this means that cards can mean different things in different [Zones](/rules/game_component_reference/zone/index). [Card Reference](/rules/game_component_reference/card/index) explains how DML encodes information to regular cards and how they interface with the game rules.

Rolling the dice is a core feature of the game and it is used to settle all in-game transactions of goods. However, specific dice roll results can initiate special game sequences that are explained in the [Dice Rolls](/rules/game_component_reference/dice_roll/index) section.

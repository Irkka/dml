# Dragon's Money Laundering – Game Developer's README

## Introduction

Dragon's Money Laundering – or DML for short – is an open-source card game for a regular deck of playing cards. It is developed and maintained by a team of Core Developers and an international team of volunteer artists. The Core Rules are currently copyright by Ilkka Hakkarainen under the Finnish copyright law.

For more information about licensing Dragon's Money Laundering and project-related assets for any purpose – commercial or non-commercial alike –, please contact the Core Developer team at <dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com>.

## Contributing

Dragon's Money Laundering accepts artistic and rules contributions alike. It encourages the community itself to help create the world and develop it further. Whether it is enhanced rules, paintings, songs or videos, let the Core Development team know about them. Dragon's Money Laundering is a living project that continuously incorporates ideas to itself.

### How to contribute?

The project source material can be acquired from its [Github repository](https://github.com/Irkka/dml). Community members are encouraged to submit their ideas by using the project [issue tracker at Github](https://github.com/Irkka/dml/issues) or submit rules patches by using the Pull Request method.

Other assets can be send by email or other equivalent means; for the tech-savvy, Pull Requests are still just as good, however.

More in-depth information about the code of conduct can be found in the separate [contribution guide](https://github.com/Irkka/dml/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please, contact the [Core Developer team](mailto:dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com) for further information.

### What's in it for you?

For starters – all contributors are awarded the highly coveted Dragon's Money Laundering contributor status. However, despite the game's nature, Dragon's Money Laundering hasn't been designed with profit in mind. All work is done for the love of the game. Above all – this game is a shout-out to all the Core Developers' favorite game designers and artists. Hopefully, it offers a similar platform to other creative workers.

#### Professionals

Monetary compesation is reserved only to professional artists and teams, who can create a stylistically cohesive whole of all the necessary game assets – be them tutorial videos, digital paintings for the cards, or the official soundtrack. For more information about making the game into a product, contact the Core Developer team at <dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com>.

### About the project

Dragon's Money Laundering is already a multimedia experience with its digital and analog paintings, theme song and rules. All project related assets are stored and version controlled in a single [master repository at Github](https://github.com/Irkka/dml).

All Dragon's Money Laundering products – be them the Core Rules, cheatsheets and the website – will be generated from the contents of the master repository's master branch.

#### Domains

Many people work on Dragon's Money Laundering in parallel, and they need to work on a single shared repository of knowledge. However, not all topics are necessary for every game developer – be them digital painters or rules-patch writers –, and thus the project itself has been divided in to logically separate – yet intertwined – domains: Rules, Assets and Meta. This separation of concerns removes the coupling between these domains and it enables the developers to concentrate on the area they're most proficient with, and hopefully it'll prevent any unwanted merge conflicts upstream in the unrelated domains.

The domains themselves form a small hierarchical structure, where the Assets and Meta domains are subservient to the Rules domain. The Rules are the canonical version of the game and thus all derivative assets and meta elements have to adhere to this view of the game world. Naturally, the Rules go only so far in depicting the world, so the other domains are given artistic freedom as long as the content is based on the game itself.

##### Rules

The main purpose of this project is to enable seasoned board-/cardgamers to have a high quality game engine easily available wherever they are. The rules of the game have to be solid and unambiguous. Events, Character Powers and Vantage Bonuses have to be balanced and the game sequence has to be robust enough to handle heavy rules abuse from power gamers and weird deck configurations – whether due to poorly shuffled decks or plain chance.

##### Assets

The world of Dragon's Money Laundering can be expanded upon in a multitude of ways. Assets can be basically anything that enhance the game experience outside the boundaries of the actual rules – digital paintings, videos, songs and the like.

The Asset domain's importance is paramount when captivating the interest of new players. It's also the domain the Core Developer team needs the most help with.

##### Meta

Meta is the catch-all domain that encompasses everything from achievements to legal issues. Everything that has something to do with the Dragon's Money Laundering project, but is not inherently a rules modification or an asset to be rendered alongside the rules text, falls into this domain.

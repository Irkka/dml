# Dragon's Money Laundering – Game Developer's README

Dragon's Money Laundering is an open-source card game developed on a platform of regular deck of playing cards with two jokers included. It is actively developed by a team of Core Developers and an international team of volunteer artists. The Core Rules Wiki is currently copyright by Ilkka Hakkarainen, save for all related assets that are yet to be licensed. For more information about licensing Dragon's Money Laundering and project-related assets for any purpose - commercial or non-commercial alike -, please contact the Core Developer team at <dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com>.

## How to contribute?

Dragon's Money Laundering accepts contributions of any kind to the master project repository and encourages the players and the community themselves to be a part of making the game experience better. Whether it is better rules, artwork or tutorial videos, let us know about your ideas and we might just incorporate them to the master repository. This way you can be a part of this living project and gain DML contributor status for whatever that's worth!

### Project domains

DML project has been divided into to separate, but intertwined, domains: rules, assets and meta. Depending on one's abilities and interests, the developers can choose the domain they feel the most proficient with.

#### Rules

The main purpose of this project is to enable seasoned board-/cardgamers to have a high quality game engine easily available wherever they are. The Master Rules Wiki has to be solid and unambiguous. Events, Character Powers and Vantage Bonuses have to be balanced and the game sequence has to be robust enough to handle heavy rules abuse from power gamers and weird deck configurations, whether due to poorly shuffled decks or plain chance.

Change suggestions to the rules can be issued in many ways. Easiest way is to simply contact one of the Core Developers at <dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com>. However, if you want to have your name in the git history or otherwise adopt the workflow used by the Core Development Team, you can refer to the technical contribution guide below.

#### Assets

Dragon's Money Laundering is already a multimedia experience. With concept art, tutorial videos and theme music emerging the game world is continuously expanding and evolving through iterative process.

Assets can be basically anything that enhance the DML experience outside the boundaries of game rules. Creativity and the ability to build on the work of other people are highly esteemed and always rewarded traits among the DML developer community.

The Asset domain's importance is paramount when captivating the interest of new players. It's also the domain the Core Developer Team needs the most help with.

#### Meta

Meta is the catch-all domain that encompasses everything from achievements to websites. Everything that has something to do with the Dragon's Money Laundering project, but is not inherently a rules modification or an asset to be rendered alongside the rules text, falls into this domain.

**Domain administrator:** Core Developer Team

### Technical Contribution Guide

Contributing directly to the project happens by using git version control system. However, the underlying technologies used in the game Master Rules Wiki and assets may vary a lot. The Master Rules Wiki is built using a collection of gulp tasks, but the assets may utilize whatever application the artist has deemed worthy.

Dragon's Money Laundering Core Development Team prefers the use of free and open-source utilities, and content created by using them always takes precedence.

*Dear Billy,*

Look how you've grown, m'boy. Seems like yesterday when you we're still selling cattle at the Outpost market square. Yet, it has become time for you to travel to Four Corners, the crown jewel of the Realm, where the borders of great kingdoms meet. In there battles are not fought by steel but by gold and cunning. At the ever-buzzing Grand Market Place of Four Corners precious commodities of the Realm tirelessly change hands. In there eager men and noble women acquire and forfeit great fortunes.

There are many ways to bring glory and wealth to your kingdom. Gathering resources and honest trading are but a single way to achieve your goals.

## About the Master Rules Wiki

The Master Rules Wiki is the authoritative source of the latest Dragon's Money Laundering rules. In a sense, it's a living rulebook that gets ever better. It is used as the source to build each implementation of rules medium, be them web pages, man pages, books, and so on.

All the project related assets are also part of the repository and as such are subject to change.

### Structure

The Master Rules Wiki is divided in to three logical main sections. Each of them are intertwined with each other on the project level, yet they are their own separate whole. They assist various developers to locate project artifacts relevant to their abilities without confusion.

The *[Assets](/assets/index)* section contain all artwork, music, screenplays and the like used throughout the project build processes and marketing. They are developed by volunteers willing to make Four Corners come to life and subsequently leave their own unique impression to it.

The *[Meta](/meta/index)* section is a collection of project-related meta data. Most importantly it gives credit where credit is due.

The *[Rules](/rules/index)* section is naturally where the game itself resides.

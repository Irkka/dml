# About the Master Rules Wiki

The Master Rules Wiki is the authoritative source of the latest Dragon's Money Laundering rules. In a sense, it's a living rulebook that gets ever better and thus is never *truly finished*. It is used as the source to build each implementation of rules medium, be them web pages, man pages, books, or so on.

In Dragon's Money Laundering Master Rules Wiki nothing is set in stone. The project is being developed in lean and agile manner and as such all rules and assets are subject to change. When new and improved versions of old rules or assets arise, they'll be reviewed and incorporated to the Master Rules Wiki repository, thus superseding the previous iteration. However, complete rulesets and new assets are bundled into official major releases, so that the casual player doesn't have to be constantly referring to nightly rules builds.

## Structure

The Master Rules Wiki is divided into three logical domains. Each of them are intertwined with each other on the project level, yet they are their own separate whole. They assist various developers to locate project artifacts relevant to their abilities without confusion.

The *[Assets](/assets/index)* domain contains all artwork, music, screenplays and the like used throughout the project build processes and marketing. They are developed by volunteers willing to make Four Corners come to life and subsequently leave their own unique impression to it.

The *[Meta](/meta/index)* section is a collection of project-related meta data. This meta data usually doesn't fall into either of the other main sections: Assets or Rules. Most importantly the Meta section gives credit to where credit is due.

The *[Rules](/rules/index)* section is naturally where the game itself resides. All major changes to the rules need to be thoroughly play-tested. The latest official game release will be built from a certain point in the version control tree, but experimental rules can be accessed from nightly rules builds and directly from the Master Rules Wiki repository.

## Contributing

The Master Rules Wiki and related assets are all developed by volunteers. No monetary compensation can be expected, or in fact even be considered at this point of development. All contributors whose assets are merged to the mother project  will however be awarded a visible position on Contributors page.

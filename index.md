## Introduction

In a land governed by capitalism, there lives four merchant kings – each mighty in their own respects. One is know for his superior military prowess; the second for his unparalleled mastery of all things clandestine; the third for his dominion over untold number of beasts and men; and the fourth for his immeasurable riches. The kingdoms ruled by these men share a border – a single point – that divides the realm in four. This place is the free city of Four Corners – the epicenter for the future events to unravel.

**Dragon's Money Laundering** is a card game for 3-4 players that takes approximately 1½ hours to finish. Each player is one of the four merchant kings trying to compete for financial superiority over the others. The merchant kings trade for resources at the Four Corners marketplace and hire the help of various city officials and noble female figures to gain the upper hand. The plot thickens with the arrival of a mysterious foreign merchant and the promise of a new incredibly rare commodity: dragon eggs.

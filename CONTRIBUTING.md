All Pull Request have to meet these minimum requirements before being accepted to the master repository.

Additionally, refer to [Github's article on their issue tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and especially how to use references and mentions to notify other developers and close and refer to related issues from commit messages.

### Rules and other text

Before submitting any rules or other textual patches, please refer to this checklist:

- [] Concise
- [] Spell-checked
- [] Tab-indentation; see [Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI) for reference, except the 'Vim over Emacs' part. That's just plain wrong. Vim's better.

### Artwork

All artwork has to come together as a complete stylistical whole in the end product. This requires tight communication between the artists, and thus all contributions should start with contacting the [Core Developer team](mailto:dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com) directly.

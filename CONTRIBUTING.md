# Contributing

The Core Developer team prefers the use of free and open-source utilities, and content created by using them always takes precedence. All assets have to be modifiable without having to buy expensive software licenses.

Core Developers recommend at least the following free software packages: GIMP, Inkscape, Blender and Scribus.

## Techinal step-by-step guide

Dragon's Money Laundering project uses git version control system to manage multiple parallel workers. If a contributor wants their name in the git history or to use the official [issue tracker](https://github.com/Irkka/dml/issues), they can follow these steps.

### Reporting issues

If you find something wrong with the project and you don't have the time or willingness to patch it yourself, please inform us and we'll attempt to fix it. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Irkka/dml/issues) is the optimal choice for the job, but other methods are supported as well.

#### Issue tracker

1. Navigate to the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Irkka/dml/issues) at GitHub
2. Create a new issue
3. Label the issue accordingly
4. Describe the issue in necessary detail

#### Email, facebook and the like

1. Contact us by [email](mailto:dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DML101)
2. Describe the issue in necessary detail

### Submitting commits

If you want your name written in the version control history of the project, you can do the patching yourself. This way is essentially the same as how the Core Developer team does it.

#### Rules enhancements, artwork or other assets

1. Fork the [Dragon's Money Laundering repository](https://github.com/Irkka/dml) from GitHub to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your repository to your local computer
3. Make your suggested changes on a feature branch.
4. Push the changes to GitHub
5. Create a Pull Request

## Style

All Pull Request have to meet these minimum requirements before being accepted to the master repository. Cohesive style across the domains makes the project much more easier to navigate through for other developers.

### Git

#### Commit messages

Every commit message has to adhere to the guidelines found at [tpope's blog post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Additionally, refer to GitHub's [article](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) on their issue tracker, and especially how to use references and mentions to notify other developers and to close and refer to related issues from commit messages.

### Rules and other text

Before submitting any rules or other textual patches, please refer to this checklist:

- [] Concise
- [] Spell-checked
- [] Tab-indentation; see [Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI) for reference, except the 'Vim over Emacs' part. That's just plain wrong. Vim's better.

### Artwork

All artwork has to come together as a complete stylistical whole in the end product. This requires tight communication between the artists, and thus all contributions should start with contacting the [Core Developer team](mailto:dragonsmoneylaundering@gmail.com) directly.

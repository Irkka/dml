# Contributors

The making of Dragon's Money Laundering started many a year ago. It was inspired by a completely unrelated game with the most bad-ass of names – the only part of it that lived on. Now anyone can contribute to Dragon's Money Laundering by honing the rules, or supplying their own illustrations, related literary art or music. Any form of contributions are gladly received – the more imaginative the better. Dragon's Money Laundering is created to stoke creativity!

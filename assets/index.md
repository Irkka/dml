# Assets

Here can be found different kinds of material for the game, some which is useful for mere gameplay, and art & music to spark the mood for chill &/or manic gaming sessions.

Dragon's Money Laundering core development team values human creativity to a high degree and as such encourages anyone to take up the challenge of making Four Corners become alive. An asset can be any arbitrary work of art that brings more end-user value to the Dragon's Money Laundering experience. This is where asset developers can really let their imaginations reign free!

For example, audio assets can be goofy soundboard apps or more complete musical pieces to the official soundtrack. Graphics assets on the other hand can be images of Four Corners' cityscape or its dwellers, notable characters or dreadful dragons. Videos section can have tutorial videos, animations or even well-written screenplays for longer video pieces. More about different asset types can be read from their dedicated pages.

If someone invents a new viable category, it'll be added alongside these. Assets really can be whatever the asset developers might come up with.
